# Adaptive-Intelligence-Framework
Adaptive Intelligence Framework (AIF) formalizes intelligence as a boundary-regulated adaptive process. Grounded in SymC principles, it studies how systems maintain coherence under uncertainty through constraint negotiation, regulation, and phase transitions - focusing on adaptive stability rather than benchmark optimization or ML scaling.
